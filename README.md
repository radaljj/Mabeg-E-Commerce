Web application that ueses Spring boot as backend and Angular as frontend. This is a final project on my university. It's a E-Commerce web application that allows users to purchase desired items from the web shop. The fullstack application uses MySql database, as well as web security(Okta service).
Application records all successful purchases in the database.
